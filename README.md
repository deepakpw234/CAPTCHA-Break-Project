# 1. CAPTCHA Break Model

This project focuses on developing a CAPTCHA-breaking model that converts CAPTCHA images into text. We utilised a Random Forest regressor to accurately perform conversion, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.99%. As part of a broader initiative, this model aims to automate CAPTCHA recognition using machine learning techniques, allowing for the breaking of CAPTCHAs across multiple websites and facilitating the automation of web scraping processes.

#### 2.1: CAPTCHA scraping and Dataset
- In this project, the dataset is created from the CAPTCHA images themselves. First, a large number of CAPTCHA images were scraped from the Election Commission of India website, and then the team organized and labeled them into folders to make the dataset suitable for training and prediction. This process ensures a custom-built dataset, enhancing the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance in CAPTCHA recognition and prediction.

- You can download the dataset by [clicking here](https://github.com/deepakpw234/Project-Datasets/blob/main/Captcha%20Dataset.zip)

#### 2.2: Data ingestion
- In this section of the project, the dataset is first downloaded from the GitHub repository and then unzipped to prepare it for further data transformation and analysis. This step ensures that the raw data is readily accessible and in the appropriate format before undergoing any preprocessing or transformation procedures.

#### 2.2: Data transformation
- In this section of the project, the ingested data undergoes a transformation process, where it is converted into a binary format to ensure it is suitable for the model to effectively fit and make accurate predictions. This transformation is crucial for optimizing the model's performance and ensuring that the input data aligns with the expected binary format to fit in the model.

#### 2.2: Model training
- First, the transformed data is divided into training and testing sets to ensure proper evaluation. After this, a model is trained on each of the six characters present in the CAPTCHA image individually. For the training process, Random Forest Regression is employed to predict the characters, with the goal of achieving the highest possible accuracy.\
 =============================================\
Accuracy and Error value for character: 1
1. Mean absolute error is: 0.17055555555555552
2. Mean square error is: 0.05403888888888899
3. Root Mean square error is: 0.23246266127894388

   The R2_Score is: 0.9999072441742654\

#### 2.2: Training and prediction pipeline
- The training and prediction pipeline is designed to handle any new CAPTCHA. In this process, the new image is first split into six individual characters. Each character is then converted into its binary representation. Saved trained model are loaded and use to predict the CAPTCHA text by using these binary inputs for each character, providing an accurate prediction of the original CAPTCHA text.
